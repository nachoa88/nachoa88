## Hi there, I'm Nacho ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ¤“ About me :
> [!NOTE]
> I'm a game & web developer and I live in Barcelona. Over the past few years, I have undergone a professional transition, moving from the educational sector to the world of programming and development. I started my journey by learning Unity and C# on my own, and later, I consolidated my skills with an integral full-stack web development course.  
> If you want to know more about me, here's my [Portfolio](https://ignacioalbiol.tech/).  

### ðŸ’¾ Iâ€™m currently working on:
Pokedex with Poke-API.
> [!WARNING]
> The project is still in development, but there is a stable version online with some of the features, [check it!](https://pokedex-iap.netlify.app/).
