## Hi there, I'm Nacho ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ¤“ About me :
> [!NOTE]
> I'm a full stack developer who successfully transitioned from the education sector to web development. My experience as a teacher taught me the importance of organization, teamwork, and problem-solvingâ€”skills I now bring to every line of code I write.
> I have worked with technologies like C#, JavaScript, React, and Java, and I recently completed a PHP Full Stack bootcamp, where I learned to build full applications using tools such as Laravel, Tailwind, and Docker. What I enjoy the most is solving complex problems and creating applications that deliver real value.
> When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m learning something new or refining my personal projects. Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects and continue growing as a professional.
  
> If you want to know more about me, here's my [Portfolio](https://ignacioalbiol.es/).  

### ðŸ’¾ Iâ€™m currently working on:
Blackjack - API: PHP Laravel project & Front: Vue 3.
> A RESTful API based on the classic card game. It allows users to register, log in, update their nickname, delete their account, view a list of users, play games, and view global and personal rankings. Developed in PHP-Laravel and MySQL, it uses Passport for authentication and Spatie for role and permission management. Documentation was created using Swagger.
> Currently I'm working on improving the gameplay, adding some features for the API and developing the front end that consumes that API.
> [!WARNING] The project is still in development, I'll soon update the link with front end, for now you can check the API [check it!](https://blackjack-api.ignacioalbiol.es/api/documentation).
